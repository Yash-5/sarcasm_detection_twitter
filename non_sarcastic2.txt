That's just my story though. Mines is much different from the rest so of course I'll never get it.|||||Pick New York, Melo! RT @LakersNation  Carmelo Anthony is thinking either Knicks or Lakers, with a side of Bulls. http://t.co/n0RkUvrTGU|||||Terrence Ross passes Cedric Ceballos, Tony Delk, Dana Barros, and Willie Burton to record the least likely 50-point game in NBA history.|||||Yea that Terrence Ross 51 point game literally came out of nowhere. It's not like he's been having a breakout season. Could be the game tho|||||Like I don't have what I would call great experiences with women in my life but I don't have real negative thoughts about them as a whole.|||||I'm fully prepared for the Lakers to be irrelevant until I hit my 30s at least. I just hope this draft can change that course.|||||Nick Young is on that #EmbraceTheTank tonight. He's been awful|||||Gonna get on home and watch the #TankShow|||||Good morning! It's one week until the Super Bowl, and eight days until you start pretending to be even slightly interested in baseball.|||||That last Melo assist was hilarious. Like his body was rebelling against the act of passing.|||||#Message RT @LunchGod: Light beer is childish. Be a man.|||||A wise dude once tweeted that besides trophies, stats are the only form of evidence we have. Everything else is subjective.|||||The Laker hate and envy ignores that we mostly have been a top notch organization. We'll see if Jim Buss can continue that.|||||#NOPE RT @LakersNation: Terrence Ross. #FutureLaker|||||Triple double for Kevin Durant. 30 points, 12 rebs, 10 assists|||||Lakers fans + beat writers who think we shouldn't tank lMO are missing the big picture. They think we'll just be great again by birthright.|||||Orlando is gonna try to crank up the Tank to blow this game.  Let's see if we can out do them.|||||#LOL RT @TJFsports: Wait nope, I've found it, worst spacing ever on a Wiggins baseline drive. Somehow ends in a 3 http://t.co/IXl4EO4JYC|||||Don't understand why people hate stats so much, but I'm not them and they don't see things like I do so there is that.|||||EVERY team we play looks like an offensive juggernaut. Orlando's offense stinks and look at what they're doing.|||||Stop sexualizing our girl children and calling them "hos" and "smuts"|||||…the foundation for the Lakers Kobe era started to be built in 1989 when West was drafting studs with late round picks.|||||This tweet https://t.co/BRBZFTs2FY  is an example of why I wrote THIS article http://t.co/qmQleumY3v|||||I told a girl "Well I'm an Aquarius so I'm good at getting things wet" I actually heard her pussy close for business|||||It would be a big favor for the Wizards to blow this game tonight like I know they're capable of.|||||Knicks are favored over the Lakers today by 10. Seems legit.|||||Magic unexpectedly retiring would have been devastating to most orgs. But West had them back on track after only missing one playoff.|||||I'd attribute that to us playing most of our East road games while we were somewhat healthy, tho we did beat Toronto &amp; Boston after that.|||||J.J. Redick is so mean|||||That one trip to finals really gave Iverson fans all the ammunition they'll ever need. Can't talk to them about him, we know this.|||||We might actually take this L. I thought Orlando would be so terrible we couldn't do it, but our defense has risen to the occasion.|||||Ryan Kelly's about to go for a career-high with Carmelo Anthony guarding him.|||||Hey, Red Sox are defending champs! I'm a little interested in baseball….emphasis on little lol|||||Durant and LeBron really is shaking up to be another MJ vs. Charles like saga. Hope Durant can get a ring.|||||@bball_ref The search box no longer works for teams, only players. Is that a permanent change?|||||New! The Black Guy Who Tips Podcast 627: Terry Died For This Show - http://t.co/G19ysGllJG Retweet and Vote!|||||It burns me up that people believe the Lakers just became good because they are the Lakers…|||||@snottiedrippen @boptimusprime @smooth_orator Only if we can gather enough assets between now and 2016|||||As in "that ho over there"? A child? RT @Under6ftNoBeard: Noap. Keep this thotler away from my son http://t.co/cqBmEvW2zv”|||||RT @kobebryant #ThisCouldBeUsButYouPlayin http://t.co/jnmeoBz61A|||||I hope KD gets a ring too. Just can't really root for it til he joins the side of evil or the 2017 playoffs. Whatever comes first.|||||When we trade Pau, we're gonna secure that top 5 pick.|||||This is really our only chance to get an impact player in the draft. He's not coming in Free Agency if we have nothing to offer.|||||“Dre, don’t bother trying to seal Withey. I got this.” *airballs* “Don’t look at me. That’s my shot." http://t.co/DKZLQxrRlL|||||Terrence Ross scored 5.5% of his career points tonight. If Damian Lillard did that he'd score 136.|||||There damn sure isn't 3 teams in the NBA worst than the Lakers. We shot 54.5% on 3s last night on last by 9 to the Orlando Magic.|||||Terrence Ross scored 48 points in his last 6 games before tonight|||||Lakers were 13-13 at one point. We've gone 3-15 since.|||||Oladipo styling on us too now? Smh|||||I just looked up that the Lakers have only been favored 7 times in 44 games so far this year. That's crazy.|||||I did not know pulling out was a sin. Learn something new everyday.|||||Thank all that is good and pure. RT @DrewGarrisonSBN: Crisis averted. RT @GoodmanESPN: Embiid now up and looks fine. Bumped knees.|||||#TankShow RT @HPbasketball: ... RT @mcten: D'Antoni says Ryan Kelly will start out on Melo. Also, Nick Young will start over Wes Johnson|||||Was on the edge for a while, but Ford and Pelton putting forth the argument for Vonleh over Randle has more or less pushed me over.|||||Great night for Carmelo. Happy for him. I'll still burn things if the Lakers sign him as a free agent.|||||@no_cut_card So this was the steak knife situation? Makes perfect sense.|||||"Load the tank shells!" RT @mcten: D'Antoni says Ryan Kelly will start out on Melo.|||||Same. RT @DrewGarrisonSBN: /bets life savings RT @HPbasketball: Wow, Cavs -1 at home vs.Suns today.|||||NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! RT @netw3rk: NO NO NO NO RT @CTowersCBS: NO! RT @GoodmanESPN: Joel Embiid down and grabbing his knee|||||The "spacing" in that picture should be exhibit one for how Self has been terrible at using Wiggins this year. Good grief.|||||Just checked the local long range forecast and,say, did you know that Peyton Manning is 1-0 in rainy Super Bowls?|||||New! The Black Guy Who Tips Podcast 628: Mam Glam - http://t.co/sMQo9C28VJ Retweet and Vote!|||||I really don't think we'll sign Melo even if he wants to join us. I hope I'm correct.|||||If you have to actually TELL somebody "I'm here for you" ... They don't want you there for them.|||||"They instituted the dress code cause Stern was hating on the powers AI's durag gave him. Only reason he didn't get a ring." #LegendsOfAI|||||Some niggas just got way too many problems with opposite sex and they need to fix it.|||||The problem I have with people who like to talk trash about advanced stats that there is no gray area for them.|||||I just be wondering how far back it goes for men who think mostly nothing but the worst of women and young girls.|||||Yeah AI put up 27 a game. He also had a legendary COY coach install an elite defense, had a DPOY and a 6MOY, but the narrative is "no help"|||||@pinky_balboa I'm already wearing a suit like once a week. Bout to add the briefcase and do the devil's work.|||||Carlton's stealing the ball from Terrence Ross at some point|||||@no_cut_card You was wilin bruh. Don't know how you did it and lived to tell lol|||||Melo with 37 in the 1st half? Ok then|||||Lakers 3-15 in their last 18. The NBA worst Milwaukee Bucks in that timeframe? 3-15, including a win in Staples Center.|||||Lakers in the last 18 games would rank 25th in offense and 29th in defense. In a completely unrelated note they're 3-15 over that stretch|||||I liked AI too, but that was one of the worst conferences in basketball history. Context. Also we act like Mutumbo didn't exist.|||||Here's a weird stat…the Lakers are 5-5 against the East on the road, but just 2-5 at home.|||||

A real relationship is where you can tell each other everything &amp; anything. No secrets, No Lies.|||||Just cause I don't text you first, doesn't mean I don't want to talk. I just want you to start the conversation for once.|||||A "good morning" text from that special person, is the best way to start the day.|||||That urge you get to write, "No one gives a shit" on someone's status.|||||when w i l l y o u r e a l i z e h o w m u c h i f u c k i n g c a r e a b o u t y o u|||||Have a nice life, I'm done trying to be in it.|||||I'm a sarcastic bitch. Deal with it.|||||I don't know what to talk about... but I wanna talk to you. :)|||||Worrying is a waste of time.|||||Relationships are harder now because conversations become texting, arguments become phone calls, and feelings become status updates.|||||Forget about what everyone else says or thinks. If it makes you happy, go for it.|||||That awkward moment when you trust someone and they decide to screw it up .|||||Looking great in mirrors, terrible in pictures.|||||When my internet stops working for 5 seconds, so does my heart.|||||I don't care about anybody else, I just want to be good enough for you|||||That awkward moment when someone asks you what's wrong and they're the problem.|||||I constantly tell myself ''I'm done'' but then I find myself trying again|||||Unless you know the whole situation and the FACTS ... Keep your mouth shut.|||||Saying "I'm tired " when you're actually sad.|||||If we talk, then we talk. If we don't, then we don't. If it goes somewhere, then it goes somewhere. If it doesn't, then it doesn't.|||||88% of people reading this will not find the the mistake in this: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z - RT if you find it.|||||Life doesn't get easier, you just get stronger.|||||Sometimes all I want is a hug.|||||When did I stop being good enough for you?|||||I am who I am. I’m weird, I’m lame, I run into things, I spill food, I trip, I scream about random &amp; stupid stuff. But, I like it that way.|||||16 &amp; Pregnant? How about 18 and graduated?|||||No offense but I'm about to offend you.|||||When did I stop being good enough for you?|||||Dear math, I am tired of finding your "x". Just accept the fact that she's gone, and move on!|||||Who needs a summer body when you could have pizza?|||||seeing a guy play with little kids is the most attractive thing ever|||||A smile is the prettiest thing you can wear.|||||I curse way too fucking much, I need to stop that shit.|||||Summer clothes &gt; Winter clothes|||||stu(dying).|||||"I trust you" is better than "I love you" because you may not always trust the person you love, but you can always love the person you trust|||||#LifeWouldBeAlotBetterIf there were more Reasons To Smile. ☺|||||*sits in towel for several hours after showering* 🛀🚿|||||When I drop my phone, I act like I've let a new born baby slip through my hands.|||||If I have my headphones in, don't fucking talk to me.|||||Friend: "Aww, someone needs a hug!" Me: "Don't touch me."|||||Every relationship has its problems, but what makes it perfect is if you still want to be together when things go wrong.|||||Dear God, for everything that happened in my life, good or bad, thank you, it makes me who I am today, I'm thankful.|||||When I get bored in class, I read those cheesy posters teachers put up around the classroom.|||||We fight, we kiss, we hug, we text, we talk, we argue, we laugh, we smile, we love... That's us!|||||The worst feeling is when someone makes you feel special, then suddenly leaves you hanging and you have to act like you don’t care at all.|||||That one crush that never really goes away.|||||When I text someone and they dont text me back, I automatically assume that they fainted of excitement.|||||I hate it when I'm trying to be serious, but then I accidentally smile.|||||If they say they don't care, it's because they're afraid to admit they do.|||||I don't think it's possible to forget someone who gave you so much to remember.|||||Don't ask why she's crying, just make her smile.|||||It's funny how I'm good at giving advice to others, but when it comes to helping myself, I don't know what to do.|||||I speak two fluent languages. English and sarcasm.|||||I love staying up late.|||||Promise me you'll never forget all times we spent together and promise me no one will take my place in your heart.|||||Im a teen. I have a messy room. I spend most of my time online. I have private things on my cell. I go to bed late &amp; Im crazy about 1 person|||||I just need someone to understand what I'm feeling right now.|||||Sometimes a simple "I miss you" changes everything.|||||You never fail to amaze me. Everyday there is something new that makes me love you even more then the day before.|||||I'm not ignoring you, I'm just waiting to see if you'll make an effort.|||||Sometimes, when I say "I'm okay", I want someone to look me in the eyes, hug me tight and say, "I know you're not"|||||I wanna be the person you fall for when everybody else is falling for you.|||||Retweet if someone is on your mind right now.|||||I won't apologize for who I am.|||||I truly respect the people who stay strong when they have every right to break down.|||||Do you wanna have sex with me? Options: A) Wave at me for yes. B) Have sex with me for no.|||||I feel like I'm not good enough for you.|||||I still remember how we started talking, I trusted you with things I would of never trusted anyone else with, and then you left.|||||"Hey is that.."- "Keep walking, keep walking, JUST KEEP WALKING!"|||||I love it when a baby holds your one finger.|||||That mini heart attack you get when someone says "We need to talk."|||||I'm a genius by birth, and lazy by choice.|||||Have a nice life, I'm done trying to be in it.|||||If you ignore me, I will ignore you. If you don't start the conversation, we won't talk. If you don't put in the effort, why should I?|||||"Where is the remote?" "All the way over there." "Guess I'm watching this."|||||I'm made of mistakes, disappointments, and failures, but trust me, there's a part of me worth keeping. ♥|||||I curse way too fucking much, I need to stop that shit.|||||if im ever on a date &amp; its bad.. just gonna stand up &amp; say, "im an actor,they're all actors,and you're on MTV's disaster date!" &amp; run out ;)|||||Fuck texting.
