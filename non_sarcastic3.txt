;;;;;
It's not about who youve been with, it's about who u end up with. Sometimes the heart doesnt know what it wants until it finds what it needs|||||Do you ever just wanna grab someone by the shoulders, look them deep in the eyes and whisper, "No one gives a fuck."|||||Guy friends are the best! And hilarious, not awkward, fun to hang out with...until you start to like one of them.|||||I miss you as soon as you leave.|||||Someone who really loves you sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, how hard u are to handle, but still wants u in their life.|||||I like conversations where I don't have to think about what to say, it just comes naturally.|||||Life would be perfect if: Mondays were fun, junk food was healthy, drama didn‚Äôt exist, and goodbyes were only until tomorrow.|||||Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you meant what you promised. Silly me.|||||I care about you. Quite a lot, actually.|||||Whatever comes, let it come, what stays let stay, what goes let go...|||||I hate feeling unimportant to people that are important to me.|||||Once they see you doing better without them, that's when they want you back.|||||I'm not the best, not the most perfect but I promise to love you with my whole heart.|||||Don't be afraid of change. You may lose out on something good, but you might gain something even better.|||||Just because I don't talk to you it doesn't mean I still don't think about you. I'm just distancing myself because I know I can't have you.|||||I like texts with long replies. It makes me feel special, as if they actually want to talk to me.|||||I don't like being led on, lied to or confused. none of that, just tell me how it is from the beginning.|||||The more secure you are with yourself, the less time you spend trying to tear others down.|||||Admit it, you like someone you can't have.|||||*At home* Me: "I want to go out, I want friends." *Out* "I want to go home, I hate people."|||||You're 13. You smoke, you're not a virgin and you wear more makeup than you do clothes. Your mom must be so proud!|||||I think a lot, but I don't say much.|||||Loyal people go through the most bullshit|||||Stop over thinking, stop worrying, stop complaining. Life is too short for all that.|||||Nobody wants to be in a relationship with someone they have to "watch".|||||Dear You, I think I'm already in love with you and I don't know how.|||||I hate this feeling of not knowing what you're feeling.|||||The hardest part of acting like you dont care, is knowing how much you actually do.|||||When a guy likes you, he will text you a lot, stay up every night with you, compliment you, and always have time for you.|||||In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure.|||||You can't keep beating yourself up over what you have done in the past. Accept it, learn from it and move on.|||||I don't depend on people anymore because I'm tired of being disappointed.|||||Overprotective parents raise the best liars.|||||I don't care if our conversations get a little boring &amp; we run out of things to say, i'm just happy i'm talking to you.|||||It's so hard to forget someone that you shared so many memories with.|||||She's just pretending not to care but actually she wants to cry.|||||I didn't choose you, my heart did.|||||The only reason why I get jealous is because remember we started off as friends too.|||||I can't lose you. Because if I ever did, I'd have lost my best friend, my soul mate, my smile, my laugh, my everything.|||||I hate it when people pour my cereal. They don't know how much I want. They don't know my life. They don't know what I've been through.|||||A real man can't stand seeing his woman hurt. He is careful with his decisions and actions so he never have to be responsible for her pain.|||||People change. Feelings change. It doesnt mean that the love once shared wasnt true or real. It simply means that sometime when people...|||||Never chase love, affection, or attention. If it isn't given freely by another person, it isn't worth having.|||||Drama doesn't just walk into your life out of nowhere, you either create it, invite it, or associate with people that bring it.|||||I love my relationship with my bed. No commitment. We just sleep together every night and wake up together every morning.|||||Change and moving on is what happens when the pain of holding on becomes greater than the fear of letting go.|||||I fell in love with you, I don't know how, I don't know when, I don't know where but I did.|||||This time, last year, everything was so different.|||||Every girl is beautiful, just takes the right guy to see it.|||||Best friends, thank you for staying with me through sadness and happiness of my life, I LOVE YOU.|||||The past cannot be changed, forgotten, edited or erased, it can only be accepted.|||||Stop feeling alone. Start laughing. Stop dreaming. Start believing. Stop Fighting. Start loving. Stop thinking. Start acting.|||||Morning: Laziness. üòë Afternoon: Dying for a rest. üò¥ Night: Can't sleep.üò¨|||||I instantly smile when your name shows up on my phone.|||||My problem is I can't stay mad. I always end up forgiving people, even when they don't deserve it.|||||I dont even care anymore. If you wanna talk, hit me up, I'm not gonna try to start a conversation anymore to be left in the middle of it.|||||Success isn't what others can see, but how you feel. It's living your truth and doing what makes you truly happy. That's success.|||||If you want the present to be different from the past, study the past.|||||A true friend is someone who know the song in your heart and can sing it back to you when you have forgotten the words.|||||I need you, a lot more than you think.|||||Don't hide your scars. They make you who you are.|||||You had me at do you want anything from McDonalds.|||||I miss you...the old you.|||||One day... I'll be someone's everything.|||||Worry about your character, not your reputation. Your character is who you are. Your reputation is who people think you are.|||||I'm glad I met you. Now do me a favor and stay.|||||Music is my life. The lyrics are my story.|||||The only reason why I get jealous is because remember we started off as friends too.|||||Not everything is meant to be, but everything is worth a try.|||||Bro's before hoes, not bro's over your girlfriend.|||||The hardest decision is deciding whether to "walk away" or "try harder."|||||I act like I don't care, but deep down I swear it kills me.|||||Sometimes you keep your feelings to yourself because it's hard for someone else to understand them.|||||Me when my friends are sad: -insert 6 page text here of advice and telling them how perfect they are- Them when I'm sad: "oh sorry"|||||lf l reply to your one word texts just know that you're special.|||||I'm really hoping something good happens between us.|||||I just want to cuddle and watch movies with you.|||||We all have that ONE person that we always have feelings for no matter what. Just one look, and it takes you right back to that moment.|||||Once I'm with you, I'm with you. Nobody else matters.|||||The most important decision you will ever make is what you do with the time that is given to you.|||||Reasons why I stop replying: 1. I'm busy 2. you're boring 3. I'm mad 4. you replied with one word 5. I'm on twitter 6. I'm eating.|||||
