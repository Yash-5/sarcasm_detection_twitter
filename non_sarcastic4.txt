Saying that you're okay is so much easier rather than explaining all the reasons why you're not.|||||Never have regrets because at one point everything you did in life was exactly what you wanted.|||||Trust is the hardest thing to find and the easiest thing to lose.|||||If you told me you miss me right now, I would be so happy.|||||I shouldn't be jealous.

Or maybe a single hello, one of the ten times we pass each other during the day.|||||I wonder if you're thinking of me too.|||||Having feelings for someone is literally the worst thing that will ever happen to you.|||||I love being yours.|||||I'm so tired of waiting for you.|||||People say that bad memories cause the most pain, but actually it’s the good ones that drive you insane.|||||If you want me in your life, put me there. I shouldn't be fighting for a spot.|||||Damn, I really wish you were here when I really need you.|||||I hate how people say "I'm here for you," when really they aren't.|||||I just wanna see you. Hold you. Hug you. Touch you. Kiss you. Cuddle with you. Love you. Be there with you.|||||Be grateful for what you have, not what you want.|||||I never believed in love until i found you.|||||I hate that feeling when you go to bed knowing the next day you're going to have wake up and face reality once again.|||||It's okay to be scared. But its not okay to change who you are.|||||Today is the first day toward the beginning of the rest of your life.|||||I hate seeing you flirt with other people.|||||I instantly smile when I get a text from you. It doesn't matter what it says. It's just amazing that for that minute I crossed your mind.|||||I’m sorry I mistook all our laughs, long nights, sweet texts &amp; inside jokes as you caring. I’ll think twice before wasting my time again.|||||Make a girl smile. Send her a cute goodnight text and a goodmorning text so she goes to sleep and wakes up with a smile on her face. ❤|||||If you still carry her bags, open the door for her, tell her that shes beautiful, and show her respect...you're a real man.|||||I miss you so badly.....|||||Dimples are fucking attractive.|||||I'm not saying I don't want you, cause believe me, I do. I'm just not going to chase after you.|||||When the memories hit you, it hurts.|||||I'm not afraid to try again, I'm just afraid of getting hurt for the same reason.|||||Sometimes you miss the memories, not the person.|||||Big or small, lies are lies..|||||I'm sorry I mistook all our laughs, long nights, sweet texts &amp; inside jokes as you caring. I'll think twice before wasting my time again.|||||You texting me first = A big smile on my face:|||||"WHO'S THAT SEXY BEAST?!" Oh, I clicked on my profile again.|||||I'll ride with you through bullshit, just don't bullshit me.|||||If you don't like them anymore, don't lead them on.|||||How to treat a girl right: be honest about everything, no matter how stupid it is.|||||The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in.|||||Don't cry for what is lost. Smile for what still remains.|||||Worry less, smile more..|||||Never let a girl sleep mad or sad.|||||I pretend to be happy a lot, I'm not. Inside, I'm really fucked up.|||||Past is history.

It’s as complicated, yet as simple as that.|||||

I love it when you text me first.|||||I fell in love with your words, not you. What you said didn't turn out to be what you are.|||||I wish we could go back to how we use to be, I miss that.|||||A real boyfriend never "gives up" on his girl. He fights for her.|||||When we are together, nothing else matters.|||||Be happy. Be who you wanna be. If others doesn't like it, then let them be. Happiness is a choice. Life isn't about pleasing everybody.|||||I blame movies for my high expectations in relationships.|||||I hate losing friends just because they got into a relationship.|||||A boy's sleepy voice is seriously the sexiest thing ever.|||||You know what I want? That someone would just grab me when I walk away from them.|||||If you want to be TOGETHER, you have TO-GET-HER.|||||Choose your words, think carefully, and then speak up your thoughts.|||||Think twice before you give a fuck.|||||A perfect relationship = Two people never giving up on each other.|||||3 most painful things: trying to hide what you really feel, loving someone who loves another, and taking risk to fall in love again.|||||I may not have the cutest eyes, prettiest smile, gorgeous face or perfect body, but I do have a caring heart.|||||Me? Jealous? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.. yes.|||||A good relationship is worth the wait.|||||When they see you're doing better without them, that's when they want you back.|||||Do you ever wish you had a second chance to meet someone again for the first time?|||||Me: I'm SO happy right now. Life: LOL, one sec.|||||I don't hate you. I just lost all my respect for you.|||||Hold her hand in public, it's like saying you are proud to have her 👫|||||Girls on Periods: I'm fine. I hate you. I love you. I want ice cream. Come here. Get away. You're cute. Fuck off. Fuck that. Fuck this.|||||Me. You. Forever. Please?|||||“Are you okay?”, always the same question. “I’m fine”, always the same lie.|||||Sometimes you just need to distance yourself from people and their bullshit.|||||I don't trip. I do random gravity checks.|||||I need a 6 month vacation, twice a year.|||||I don’t have an attitude problem. You have a problem with my attitude, and that’s not my problem.|||||You are my heart most wanted. Nobody can stop me for loving you, even you can't stop me!|||||I need you. A little too much.|||||That mini heart attack you get when you're half asleep and you suddenly feel like you're falling.|||||If he honestly cared about you, he wouldn't have left. Not the first time, not the second time, and not ever.|||||I hate the idea of anyone else having you.|||||If you stay, stay forever. If you go, do it today. If you change, change for the better. And if you talk, make sure you mean what you say.|||||I truly respect the people who stay strong when they have every right to break down.|||||I still like you... a lot.|||||I have low self esteem, feel ignored, feel empty, get jealous, have trust issues, and pretty much always feel like I'm not good enough.|||||You don't need anyone who doesn't need you.|||||Time has a way of showing us what really matters.|||||She's my best friend. Break her heart and I'll break your arm.|||||Every time i look at you, it's like i'm falling in love all over and over again.|||||True friends don't talk shit about you.|||||That feeling you get when you see his name appear on your phone.|||||My name is Bond, James Bond. My name is Please, B*tch Please.|||||I really hate texting you first.|||||I don't care who was "before" me, as long as I know there's nobody "during" me.|||||I want you to know that I love you more than anything else.|||||When we first met, I had no idea you’d become this important to me.|||||Here's to the girls who have had their heart broken by a guy that they never even dated.|||||Never let the bullshit stress you.|||||The nervous feeling you get when you press the send button on a risky text.|||||I love waking up to your "good morning" text. ❤☀|||||Don't be sorry. I trusted you. My mistake, not yours.|||||No one is going to love you if you don't love yourself.|||||I miss you, but fuck you.|||||That horrifying moment when your mom says... "I need to talk to you." &amp; you think of everything you did wrong this week.|||||I really hate it when I'm in a good mood and suddenly something bad happens and ruins everything.|||||If I got paid for being lazy, I'd be a billionaire.|||||When you're truly in love , being faithful isn't a sacrifice , it's a joy&lt;3|||||She's a hoe, she's ugly, she's a bitch, she's this, she's that .. but you dated her ? please, take a seat.|||||When my bra &amp; underwear match it makes me feel like I'm a Victoria's secret model.|||||Telling people you're tired when in reality, you're just fucked up, bad mood and sad.|||||If you like me, show it. If you don't like me, don't pretend to.|||||Once you've been through the same shit over &amp; over again, you don't get your hopes up anymore. You already know what you're gonna expect.|||||Me? Jealous? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.. yes.|||||I love it when you text me first.|||||It's ironic how we ignore those who want us, want those who ignore us, love those who hurt us &amp; hurt those who love us.|||||And then Satan said... 'Put the alphabet in maths'.|||||
