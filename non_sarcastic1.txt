It's sweet when someone remembers every little detail about you, not because you keep reminding them... But because they pay attention.|||||My worst fear is losing you.|||||You fight like a married couple, you talk like best friends, and you flirt like first loves, so obviously it's meant to be.|||||One text from you and I suddenly get happy.|||||Call me old fashioned, but I actually take relationships seriously.|||||When love is real, it finds a way.|||||Relationships fall apart. Friendships end. Hearts break. But the love doesn't die. ♥|||||"You are beautiful in your own way 'cause God makes no mistakes" - Lady Gaga.|||||I'm sorry I can't just walk away like that, because unlike you, my feelings were real.|||||Just thinking about you makes me smile, imagine what I feel when I see you.|||||You know you really love someone when you can't hate them for breaking your heart.|||||You're prettiest when you're happy. Don't waste your time being sad.|||||Any boy can make a girl his number one, but it takes a man to make her his only one.|||||The "i" in princess? That's me.|||||I can't go a day without music.|||||True love is worth waiting for even if it takes a lifetime. Then in return a lifetime of love will be waiting for you.|||||Even if we fight a lot, I still want you in my life.|||||I say I don't care about you but every time my phone vibrates a part of me hopes it's you.|||||I hate being lied to by someone I've never lied to before.|||||Some people, are meant to fall in love with each other: But not meant to be together.|||||I hope you never forget me, I hope you never regret me.|||||Screw what they say. You're worth it to me.|||||Don't promise when you're happy, Don't reply when you're angry, and don't decide when you're sad.|||||Don't let the way you feel, determine how you treat someone, always treat people with kindness.|||||The scariest thing about distance is that you don’t know whether they’ll miss you or forget you.|||||Find a heart that will love you at your worst, and arms that will hold you at your weakest.|||||A boyfriend should always send you a Goodmorning &amp; Goodnight text even if you don't talk all day just to let you know you're on his mind.|||||A new day is here.. Yesterday is a memory. Tomorrow is unknown. Now is the knowing.|||||If a girl can put up with you through your worst days, and still stick with you and your mistakes, then you shouldn't let her go.|||||Most girls say they want a "good guy", but when they meet him they keep him in the friend zone, chase after jerks, and end up heartbroken.|||||Relationships are like drugs, they either kill you, or give you the best feeling of your life.|||||Smiling while I'm texting makes my parents think I have a boyfriend.|||||Just because we haven't been talking, that doesn't mean I haven't been thinking about you all the time.|||||No matter how strong of a person you are, there’s always someone who can make you weak.|||||I'm in love with you, but sometimes you make me think otherwise.|||||He ignores you, but you like him. He does nothing, but you fall for him. You miss him, even though you know he will never care.|||||You're the first person I want to talk to when I wake up and the last person I wish to see before I fall asleep|||||My best times have gone from laughter to memories. My best friends have gone from friends to family.|||||You know you really love someone when you can't hate them for breaking your heart.|||||Flirting while in a relationship is very disrespectful and while it may see harmless, it can be very hurtful to the person that loves you.|||||If I'm louder, would you see me?|||||The truth, I really miss all the crazy things you left running through my head.|||||People aren't always going to be there for you, that's why you learn to handle things on your own.|||||I care, the problem is you don't|||||I'm not even on drugs. I'm just weird.|||||She is a little scared to get close to anyone because everyone that said "I will always be here for you", left.|||||When you meet someone special, you'll know. Your heart will beat more rapidly and you'll smile for no reason.|||||When you text me, my face lights up more than my phone does.|||||Make a girl smile. Send her a cute goodnight text while she's sleeping so she wakes up with a smile on her face.|||||Have you ever had so many thoughts on your mind, but you can't make them into words?|||||Never waste time on someone who doesn’t have time for you. Be with someone who will say “time is wasted if I am not with you”.|||||I hate when people are only nice to you because they want something, then talk shit about you behind your back.|||||Don't fall in love with his words, fall in love with his actions.|||||I hate that feeling when you don't know if you should text first or wait.|||||Worst feeling in the world is knowing you did the best you could, and it still wasn't good enough.|||||I just want you. That's it. All your flaws, mistakes, smiles, giggles, jokes, sarcasm. Everything I just want you ♥|||||Never regret. If it’s good, it’s wonderful. If it’s bad, it’s experience.|||||I cried a lot because of you. I laughed a lot because of you. I believed in love because of you.|||||No matter how many quotes and song lyrics there are, sometimes words just can't describe how you feel.|||||Sometimes it’s easier to pretend you don’t care, than to admit it’s killing you. – Wiz Khalifa|||||Trust is like paper…Once it’s crumpled, it can’t be perfect again.|||||Never give up on someone you can’t go a day without thinking about.|||||You've been my 11:11 wish for a very long time.|||||Why waste your time getting hurt by someone, when there's someone else out there waiting to make you happy?|||||All I want is to get in a fight with a guy and scream at him to shut up and then he’ll push me roughly against a wall and whisper “make me”.|||||Don't pray for life to be easy, but pray for yourself to be strong instead.|||||Sometimes it’s easier to pretend you don’t care than to admit that it’s killing you.|||||I just want you. That's it. All your flaws, mistakes, smiles, giggles, jokes, sarcasm. Everything I just want you ♥|||||I miss our long talks, your smell, your smile, your laugh, your kisses, your hugs.. I wish I could have them back...|||||He ignores you, but somehow you fall for him everyday. He does nothing, but yet that's enough to win you over.|||||Being strong sometimes means being able to let go.|||||Sometimes quiet people have a lot to say, but they don't open up to just anybody.|||||Because of you, I laugh a little louder, cry a lot less, and smile a lot more.|||||I'm not a jealous person. I'm just a girl that would love to punch every other girl in the face that gives you a second look.|||||I countdown the hours until I get to see you again.|||||Distance shouldn't stop you. If you really want someone, you'll make it work.|||||I wish memories were like text messages so we could delete the ones we don't like &amp; keep the special ones forever.|||||When you have a good heart: You help too much, you trust too much, you give too much. you love too much &amp; it always seems you hurt the most.|||||If you don’t want me now, don’t miss me later.|||||"I always knew looking back on the tears would make me laugh, but I never knew looking back on the laughs would make me cry."|||||When you love someone, you just do. There are no maybe's, no but's, and no why's.|||||
